Why this paper?
============================================================================================================================================
This paper was used to understand why and how information is retained as a form of memory during a conversation. What leads to forgetting of 
a piece of information during a conversation. What is retained after the conversation gets over. How memory is retained regarding a person,
event or a situation. Do we need to store what was conversed and formed as a conversation between individuals took place in order to remember
or recollect it later. helped shed a light on how information was retained and forgetten as conversation about it happened between two people.
How conversations plays a part in remebering and forgetting informations related to incidents the individuals have experienced together, 
individually or get it know about it prior to a conversations. How Listeners due to Socially Shared Remembering Induced Forgetting forget about
how certain incidents happened in their past due to the conversations they have with a speaker.

Content - 1. Introduction
============================================================================================================================================
Authors say that although there are intense debates about the meaning of the term collective memory, almost every social scientist agress
that collective memories are not just shared individual memories, but instead are 'publicly available symbols maintained in the society'.
When viewing the study of collective memory from this perspective, scholars see commemorations and memorials as publicly available symbols
that exist in large part to preserve the past. For these scholars an important questions to answer is -
'How does society construct and maintain these symbols?'

There are psychologists that claim that one would never fully understand human actions and cognitions without considering the internal and
external factors together, often as components within a complex system.

When it comes to the study of memory, the claim would be that 'in order to understand how a person remembers what he ate last night, a
researcher needs to consider not only the neural mechanisms underlying memory, but also, for instance, the visual cues in the enviornment,
such as the pile of dished in the sink.'

The above interactional approach was again captured by a pioneer of the psychological study of memory Fredick Barlett when he likened the
act of remembering to the action of swinging a tennis racket. Most would agree that this action is not the reappearance of a previous tennis
stroke stored away in a repository of past tennis strokes but the construction of a tennis stroke out of previous experience with tennis as
well as current situational factors, such as the position of the sun, the opponent's posture, the coniditions of the court etc.

For Fredrick Bartlett remembering is the act of reconstructing the past out of both what is in the head and what is outside in the world.
It is not the retrieval of stored replicas of the past.

Althoug Fredick Bartlett was not explicit but it would appead that he felt that memories were not in the head in any specific way, but
rather in the interaction between what is in the head, the schema formed of past experience and what is in the world.

Memories are products of remembering and not stored representations of the past. They are not retrieved as a memory might be on a computer
but built out of the interactions between what is beneath the surface of the skin and the world beyond the surface.

Psychologists have long known that the more one knows about something, the better one remembers new materials that builds on this knowledge
As an example chess masters will remember a chess position better than a novice, not because they have a better memory than a novice, but
because they use their knowledge of chess to guide their remembering. They know that certain pieces are positioned according to attack or
defence strategies and then use this knowledge when memorizing and remembering the position. Their excellent performance could not be obtained
if they cannot use their knowledge and when asked to reproduce a chess position consisting of randomly placed pieces, their performance is no
better than that of novices.

In case of expert bartenders unlike chess masters, to effect their extraordinary performance, they do not rely solely on their knowledge of
drinks, rather they reach beyond what is 'in their heads' and turn to the outside world, restructuring it so that the world 'remembers' the 
drinks for them at least in part.

When novice bartenders are asked to remember a list of drinks, they merely repeat the drink order to 
themselves. If the order is long and complicated, they quickly forget the order, on the other hand, expert bartenders use the distinctive
shape of many drinking glasses to aid their memory. When they receive a drink order, they place the appropriate glass onto the bar as the
order is given. They physical presence of the glass as they subsequently fill the orders effectively guide their memory. the correspondence
between glass shapes and drinks is not one to one, but the presence of different shapes delimits the range of what needs to be remembered, 
and a result, expert bartenders find it easier to remember even a complicated drink order. Their memory per se has not gotten better rather 
the restructured world makes it easier for them to remember successfully.

When memories are viewed as a product of the interaction between what is in the head and what is in the world then notion of collective
memories as 'shared individual memories' might seem less wrong-headed.

When it comes to the bartender example an individual restructures the world so that the individual can better remember. When it comes to 
collective memory, society restructures the world so that society better remembers. For example Americans built the Lincoln Memorial so that
Americans would never forget Lincoln and more specifically that they would remember Lincoln as a god like figure.

The world is full of memorials and commemorations. Some of these memorials and commemorations effectively shape the collective memory of a 
mnemonic community, whereas others remain ineffective.

Authors say that scholars of collective memory need to know why some mnemonic resources effectively promote the formation and alteration of 
collective memories while others do not.

The answer to these questions lies in part in recognizing that memorials can potentially change the memories of visitors one at a time, and
thereby collectively all those who visit. If the change in individual memory is substantial and similar across visitors, a memorial can
effectively shape the collective memory. On the other hand if the change is minimal the effect is minimal.

Aleida Assmannn made a point by stating that 'Collective memories must have a function for the society.'

Content - 2. Conversations and Collective Memory
============================================================================================================================================
In many instances, conversations can serve as a decisive mnemonic resource for the spread of a memory across a group, even a group as large 
as a nation. Conversations may promote the formation of a collective memory as much as, if not more than, a textbook, a memorial, or a
commemoration. For instance, Lithuanians of Lithuaninan descent know their nation's history not through the Russian textbook they use in 
their school, but through the many informal conversations they have with acquaintances, friends and relatives.

The elemental influence of a speaker on a listener could extend to large communities. The influence of speakers can become widespread if they
address a large number of people. Moreover a chain of influences can also be set up, with one speaker reshaping the memory of a listener,
who in turn becomes a speaker who can influence another listener. This sequence of conversational interactions can multiply in complex ways
and may after numerous conversations, lead to a convergence onto a shared community-held rendering.

3.1 Conversations Promote Social Contagion and Memory Implantation
Social contagion refers to the spread of a memory either true or false from one person to another through social interaction. 

scholars Wright et al in a representative study of social contagion in 2000 examined in a naturalistic context, how members of conversational 
dyads can shape each other's memory for material they each viewed. Participant swere randomly assigned to complete the task individually or
as a pair.

1.Dyad Condition:
Both members of a pair studied a picture. the pictures they saw differed slightly, though the pair was led to believe they were studying the
same picture. The pair was asked to individually study the pictures and jointly recall them, and then subsequently recall what they 
remembered from the original image.

2.Individual Condition:
As individual, rather than pairs, was asked to separately study and then recall the image.

Wright et al. revealed that false recognitions for the critical items were more prevalent in the dyad condition than the individual condition.
The false recognitions in the join recall condition, after all represented shared renderings of the pictures.

3.2 The Effects of Conversational Dynamics and the Characteristics of Conversational Participants.
Not all conversations are equally effective in reshaping the memories of their participants. Nor for that matter, are all conversational
participants equally likely to induce social contagion in their listeners. 

3.2.1 The Role of the Dominant Narrator
In the studies of scholars Hirst and Manier have focused on conversations of families of four (mother, father and two children) about their
shared family experiences. They have found that conversational participants tend to naturally take on contrasting and complimentary roles.
Identifying three roles in particular: Narrators, Mentors and Monitors.

Narrators further the narratice of the episode at issue; mentors aid narrators by prompting them to further their narratives and provide more 
details; and monitors evaluate whether the narrative, as told by the narrator, was accurate and complete.

Narrators control to varying degrees, the discussion on any given topic, it is thus their version of events that emerges most prominently in
conversational remembering. example one of the conversations in Hirst and Manier's research involved a son's high school graduation present. 
The son felt aggrieved because he believed he had promised a stereo. In this conversation, he took on the Narrator role, because he was intent
on getting his account of the episode through.

Narrators also introduce unshared memories as opposed to shared memories, into conversational remembering more frequently than did non narrators.
Unshared memories are memories held by only one member of a group, while shared memories are those held by two or more members. consistent 
with an information sampling bias Hirstand Manier found a clear preference for individuals to refer to shared memories, while avoiding those 
that only they held. Narrators were the exception to this rule.

Scholar Cuc in its study found that the presence of a dominant narrator facilated the formation of a collective memory, as these individual
were successful in transmitting their contributions to the conversations into the group's subsequent collective memory.

The dominant narrator also influenced not just whether a collective memory formed, but the content of that collective memory. Just as dominant
narrators are particularly influential in spreading memories across a group during conversational remembering, the same is true of those
possessing expertise on the issue at hand. 

Another study was conducted to understand the relationship between narrators and experts. In parsing the results of the study, two main 
finding emerged:
1. Expertise is independant from narratorship, that is even if dominant narrators were not experts, they influenced the other group members 
   to a great extent.
2. Narratorship had stronger predictive value than the perceived status of expertise in how much the other group members were contaminated 
   with false memories.

In addition, Narrators, influence was not simply based on how much they spoke, but how much they spoke in relatiuon to how much others were 
speaking. Therefore by speaking a disproportionate amount, the Narrator was able to call attention to what she says and had an advantage in
crafting the narrative.

============================================================================================================================================
Researchers see that there is a growing body of research revealing that social remembering has the power to implant new memories, but could 
the converse by true as well? Questiont to answer:
1. Could conversations about the past serve as vehicles promoting forgetting as well as remembering?
2. Could the selective nature of an act of remembering shape memories that reflect both what is left unmentioned by the conversation, as well
   what was said in it?

The reason why people might not mention all that they know in a conversation are multifold: from deceiving the audience to avoiding somehting
stressful and socially taboo. They could also simply fail to access memories in the context od specific conversations.

4.1 The Effect of Selective Remembering on Subsequent Forgetting in individuals
One mechanism that might underlie the formation of collective memories through forgetting is retrival-induced forgetting (RIF). Retrieval-
induced forgetting is a memory phenomenon that can reliably be found when a person retrieves information in a selective manner. According 
together RIF framework when people return memories, other related memories automatically come to mind. In order for the retrieval to be 
successful, the rememberer must inhibit these related competing memories. As this inhibition can linger over time, the remeberer will have
difficulty recalling the related competing memories in subsequent tests of memory.

4.2 Social Dynamics and Retrieval-Induced Forgetting
Scholar Cuc et al in 2007 modified their Remembering Induced Framework (RIF) paradigm to investigate how the RIF phenomenon might bear on
remembering in a social context. specifically they observed RIF in a free flowing conversations.

The scholars found that the listener may not overtly and selectively recount a memory in a conversation, the speaker does, But the listener
nevertheless demonstrates RIF or what scholar Cuc calls Socially-Shared RIF (SS-RIF). 

Scholar Cuc et al reasoned that listeners demonstrate SS-RIF because they retrieve concurrently with the speaker, even if covertly, that is 
their findings suggest that even something as mundane as a conversation can reshape a memory by inducing speakers and listeners alike to
forget in similar ways and in doing so, promote the formation of collective memory.

In sum, scholar Cuc and his colleagures found that listening to a speaker not only enhances their memory for the information introduced by
the speaker, but it also leads to increased probability of forgetting for information related to what the speaker mentions.

Scholar Cuc et al focused on instances when both speaker and listener held a memory for the same event, however a speaker can also provoke
a listener to remember, overtly or covertly, even if the two do not share the same memories. For instance, a speaker could recall a traffic
accident and her selective recollection could evoke in a listener hisown memories of a different traffic accident. Moreover, how a speaker
recalls her traffic accident might shape how and what the listener covertly remembers. If a speaker recollects the courtesy of the ambulance 
personnel, but fails to recollect the helpfulness of the passers-by, a listener might concurrently, but covertly, retrieve the attitude of
the ambulance personnel in his own accident, but may fail, even covertly, how the passers-by reacted. If RIF is a consequence of selective 
remembering then both speaker and listener should have more difficulty subsequently recollecting the role passers-by played in their distinct
accidents thant they do recalling the courtesy of the ambulance personnel.

A conversation, then may induce participants to forget in similar ways even when memories differ.
