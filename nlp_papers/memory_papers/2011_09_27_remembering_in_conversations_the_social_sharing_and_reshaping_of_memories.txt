Why this paper?
============================================================================================================================================
This paper was used to understand whether instruct based LLMs are to be used rather than plain generative transformer based models when we 
want to produce reproducible results in the Question Answer format.

Content - 1. Introduction
============================================================================================================================================
Human memory serves variety of functions but what might be unqiue to humans is that their remembering has a communicative function.

One diary study revealed that 62% of the events recorded by participants had already been told to others by evening of the day that they 
occured. Another study tracked conversational exchanges about a class field trip to a morgue. Although the original class contained only 33
students, after 3 exchanges 881 people knew of the visit to the morgue.

According to the authors the pervasive exchange of memories may be becoming broader and quicker as social media supplies another means of 
communicating with others.

These studies show that people share with each other both their episodic and semantic memories.

Authors are particularly interested in 'remembering within a conversation'. Their interest is not in the reasons for conversing about the
past but it is in the consequences of conversational remembering for memory. To find the reasons the authors ask two sets of questions and
they are:

1. The first set of questions focuses on the memories emerging withing a conversation.
    - How does individual remembering differ from conversational remembering?
    - Is remembering in a conversation more effective than remembering in isolation?
    - Do answers of the above questions depend on the circumstances of the conversation and the participants in the conversation?

2. The second set of questions focuses on the memories emerging withing a conversation
    - This set of questions are further subdivided by distinguishing the person doing the remembering in the preceding conversation a.k.a
      the speaker from the person listening to the remembering a.k.a the listener.
    - The questions are further divided into concerns about the effect of what a participant says while in the role of a speaker on her own
      memory and what she says on listeners; subsequent memory.

Content - 2. Conversational Remembering and the Extended Mind
============================================================================================================================================
The authors say that many scholars have observed that cognition is often supported by external sources such as media, cultural institutions
or social networks. In the case of 'conversational remembering' conversations can be considered as a support.
As an example:
    - One person in the conversation for instance might remind the other of an initially forgotten memory

This means the performance of any individual conversational participant depends critically on others.
Authors say that conversations and internal processing can become so interwined that it makes it difficult to separate the two.
