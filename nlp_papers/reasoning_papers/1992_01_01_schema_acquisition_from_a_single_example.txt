Why this paper?
============================================================================================================================================
To understand how to reason with Large Language Models i wanted to understand how to reason first. There is a reason why few shot prompting
works and why models are able to provide reasons for their outputs. The underlying concept called Similarity Based Learning and Explanation
Based Learning is explained in this paper.

Content - 1. Introduction
============================================================================================================================================
In psychology two different approaches have emerged in recent research on concept formation:
    1. Similarity-Based Learning (SBL)
    2. Explanation-Based Learning (EBL)

SBL theories are based on the assumption that concepts are formed by extracting similarity across multiple examples where EBL theories 
emphasize the role of prior knowledge in leanrning new concept if a machine has sufficient domain knowledge, EBL based models have shown
success in the field of AI but there is no psychological evidence before the experiments done  in this paper that humans can learn concepts
based on a single example using EBL approaches.

The results of experiments conducted for this research paper shows that human learners can acquire a schema from a single example in knowledge
rich domains but not in knowledge-poor domains. The experiments suggest that humans learn complex information use both SBL and EBL mechanism.

2.1.1 Similarity-Based Approaches to Concept Learning
Many models of concep learning have assumed that concepts are learned through the repeated occurance of similar instances. Most of the 
traditional models reveals that most of the traditional models referred to as concepts models actually include a learning mechanism that is 
too weak for many real world examples of concept learning.

2.1.2 Similarity-Based Learning Models
Authors cover 3 traditional models of simple concepts such as rule models, probabilistic models and exemplar models
    2.1.2.1 Rule Based Models
    Rule based models are based on the assumption that a concept consists of a set of defining rules and that these concepts are learned by 
    generating hypothesis derived from initial instances and then testing the hypothesized rules. In experiments designed to show rule-based
    learning, subjects attempt to learn the concepts by observing numerous instances of the concept, However, this may not have been the
    appropriate method to study learning of these types of concepts because real-world concepts with sufficient and necessary features may 
    often be acquired by exposure to a definition rather than by observation of multiple instances.

    2.1.2.2 Probabilistic Models
    Probabilistic models are based on the assumption that concepts are represented in the form of a unique memory of their exemplars.

    2.1.2.3 Exemplar Models
    Exemplar models are based on the assumption that concepts are represented in the form of a unique memory of their exemplars.

Theories of 'schemaata' assume that forms of knowledge representations developed to account for complex knowledge such as knowledge of plans,
spatial arrangements or sequences of events have typically assumed that some form of SBL accounts for schema acquisition. For example -
1. "Scholars such as Schank and Abelson (1977) thrg=ough a series of repeated experiences, repeated events become a part of the memory whereas
    non-repeated events become subjected to change in variables"
2. "Scholars Rumelhart and Norman (1978) proposed that people acquire a new schema through either pattern recognition or through schema deduction"
3. "Scholars Van Dijk and Kintsch (1983) suggest that if a situation model is used frequently it will form a context-independent script"

2.1.3 Problems with the SBL approaches
Authors think that the SBL approach to learning faces a number of difficulties.

2.1.3.1 Relatively simple types of stimuli used in experiments to test SBL models.
    Traditional concept formation experiments have almost always used simplified experimental materials. This methodological approach was adopted
    because it was assumed that experiments using simple materials could be better controlled than those using more realistic materials and law
    defined in simplified situationcould be generalized to complex situations. SBL models have not considered the possible interactions between
    types of learning mechanisms and types of information to be learned.

2.1.3.2 The models do not take into account the role of the learner's domain knowledge.
    According to the authors many studies have pointed out the importance of background knowledge in concept formation. SBL models have not provided
    an analysis of how an individual's learning is affected by what the individual already know.

2.1.3.3 The models do not make distinction between explanatory and non explanatory informations.
    As a learning mechanism, SBL seems more appropriate for non explanatory task

2.1.3.4 The learning mechanism used in these models allow spurious correlations among examples to be generalized as constraints because
of generalization
process is not supportedby background knowledge.
    Traditional SBL models are vulnerable to spurious correlations caused by the co-occurence of irrelevant aspects of a concept. For example -
    "If an SBL system is given 10 newspaper articles on kidnapping in which all the kidnappers were wearing blue jeans, it could learn 
    blue jeans was required for kidnapping."

A learning model should be able to related co-occurences in the information to be learned to the goals of concepts to avoid spurious 
correlations. Most SBL theories would predict that no generalization will occur with a single example because these approaches do not use 
the explanatory structure of the example in the generalization process.

2.2.1 Explanation Based Learning
EBL approaches emphasize the role of people's background knowledge in concept acquisition. The prior knowledge provides a learner with 
explanation for why examples belong to a concept. Therefore if people have enough domain know. It should be possible to acquire a schema
from even a single example by generalizing its explanations.

Domain knowledge generally consists of rules relating from a function or schemata for known plans and actions. This knoweledge is used to 
explain why a particular object fulfills a certain function or why a sequence of actions achieves a goal.

There are two basic concepts of EBL systems.
1. Using domain knoweledge, the system tries to explain why the given example is an instance of the concept understudy. The explanation 
process is very important for learning because it separates relevant information from irrelevant ones and provides justified generalization
that avoid spurious correlations.
2. The second step involves a generalization process in which irrelevant features are discarded and specific values are changed to variables 
as long as the explanation remains valid.

Content - 4. Problems with EBL approaches
============================================================================================================================================
A system based on explantions can only function effectively when it has sufficient knowledge about the domain, and the schema to be learned
is organized by causal constraints, Therefore successful EBL cannot occur in domain in which the understander does not have sufficient
knoweledge to construct an explanation. EBL systems provide no mechanism for making use of similarities across multiple examples.
